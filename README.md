# Maven Roasters Sales & Consumer Trends Analysis
## Executive Summary
Using Microsoft Excel, I transformed raw sales data into an interactive dashboard to analyze customer ordering habits across different locations and time periods. This analysis revealed clear patterns in sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, which were used to develop data-driven business recommendations aimed at increasing overall revenue.
  1. Introduce Saturday Promotions
  2. Adjust Operational Hours
  3. Develop Strategic Product Bundles

## Bussiness Problems
Despite consistent month-over-month revenue growth, product sales across categories remain imbalanced. Several product categories recorded fewer than 5,000 transactions, indicating underperformance compared to others. This highlights an opportunity to improve sales distribution by increasing the visibility and appeal of lower-performing products through targeted promotions or bundling strategies.

## Methodology
Transfrom the datas and build a dashboard in **Microsoft Excel** that analize customer ordering habits.

## Skills
**Microsoft Excel**: writing functions, ETL, calculated columns, data visualization, data modeling

## Result
A dynamic dashboard was developed to analyze customer ordering habits and sales performance across different locations and time periods. With this dashboard, stakeholders are now able to easily monitor transaction trends and make data-driven decisions.
The analysis revealed several key insights:
  - **Revenue** has been steadily **increasing since February**.
  - **Fridays** consistently record **the highest transaction volume**.
  - **Peak transaction hours** are between **8:00 AM and 10:00 AM**, while the **least active periods** are at **6:00 AM and 7:00â€“8:00 PM**.
  - **Coffee** are the **highest performance**, whereas **Packaged Chocolate** have the **lowest performance**.
These findings serve as the foundation for strategic recommendations to optimize operations and improve sales performance across underperforming product categories.

## Next Steps
1. Deep-Dive Into Underperforming Product Categories
2. A/B Testing Promotions or Bundles
